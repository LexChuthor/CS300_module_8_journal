## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved by the projects in this course was choosing and implementing a data structure in which to efficiently load a college course data object into.  Then, to create algorithms in which to display, sort, and load the data.
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I considered the problem for the perspective of the efficiency to implement and the ongoing efficiency of the data structure itself.  Data stuctures are important to understand because they have different strengths and weaknesses.  An algorithm utilizing a hash table for instance, would be extrememly efficient in run-time given a very large set of data, but would take significantly longer to code and implement.  Meanwhile, a vector is quick to implement and has very little real time difference in runtime due to the small size of the data set utilized in this particular project. 
## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Any roadblock I encountered was generally solved by performing additional research into the solution.  Syntax errors are typically easy to solve by checking guides, but thinking through how to effectively solve a problem often involved theorizing multiple solutions and then attempting the one that seemed best.
## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has helped me to expand my toolset in regards to what I am able to code.  I have more specialized tools to utilize when designing and coding programs, and a better idea of which tool is best to use. 
## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project has encouraged me to continue writing programs in a way that is easily readable and modular enough to be re-usable or adaptable.
